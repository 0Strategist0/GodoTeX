GodoTeX is an add-on to Godot Mono that renders LaTeX expressions - in the editor and at runtime!

***Note**: This is still an early version and may change significantly. The project will be finished by October 2022.*

## Features
- It's *really* fast!
- Editor Integration
- Inherits all Functionality from [`Sprite`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite.html?highlight=sprite)
- Adjustable Font Size
- Adjustable Font Color
- Anti-Aliasing (with Toggle)

## Compatibility
The add-on is tested for Godot 3.4.x and is expected to run on 3.x. Support for Windows and Linux is planned. MacOS is sadly not being tested due to lack of appropriate hardware. A version for Godot 4.x will be provided after its release, if possible.

## Usage
*Documentation follows, this is not complete yet!*

## Heritage
The add-on depends on [`CSharpMath.SkiaSharp`](https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath), licensed under MIT, as a nuget package.
