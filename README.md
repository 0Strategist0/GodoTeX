# $\text{Godo}\TeX$

GodoTeX is an add-on to Godot Mono that renders LaTeX expressions - in the editor and at runtime!

***Note**: This is still an early version and may change significantly. The project will be finished by October 2022.*

## Features
- It's *really* fast!
- Editor Integration
- Inherits all Functionality from [`Sprite`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite.html?highlight=sprite)
- Adjustable Font Size
- Adjustable Font Color
- Anti-Aliasing (with Toggle)

## Compatibility
The add-on is tested for Godot 3.4.x and is expected to run on 3.x. Support for Windows and Linux is planned. MacOS is sadly not being tested due to lack of appropriate hardware. A version for Godot 4.x will be provided after its release, if possible.

## Usage
![](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/file-acomplaint/blob/main/assets/latexDemo.gif?raw=true)

A custom node `LaTeX`(![](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/GodoTeX/blob/main/addons/GodoTeX/icon.svg?raw=true)) inheriting from `Sprite` is provided and may be instanced like any other. It has the following properties, which may be updated in the editor or programmatically at runtime

- **LatexExpression**: A `string` containing the expression to be rendered. If invalid, the corresponding error message will be rendered instead.
- **FontSize**: A `float`, the font size in points. It essentially controls the resolution of the rendered image. Decrease for better performance, increase for higher fidelity.
- **MathColor**: A Godot `Color`, the typeface's color.
- **AntiAliasing**: A `bool`. The renderer may or may not be instructed to anti-aliase the rendered typeface. Note that this is distinct from Godot's own anti-aliasing.

When updating these in the editor, the expression is automatically rendered anew. When updating properties programmatically, you decide yourself when to render by calling the `.Render()` method - to save ressources. Rendering very often (several times a millisecond) may result in errors.

There is also a `LaTeXButton`(![](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/GodoTeX/blob/main/addons/GodoTeX/iconButton.svg?raw=true)) node for clickable expressions. This behaves like a `TextureButton`.

## Installation
1. Create a Godot Mono project and build a C#-script.
2. Install from the Godot Asset Store from inside the Engine or by cloning.
3. The add-on depends on [`CSharpMath.SkiaSharp`](https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath), licensed under MIT, as a nuget package. You to integrate this into your existing Godot Mono project by copying the `<ItemGroup>`-tags into your project's `.csproj`-file from `GodoTeX.csproj`.
4. Enable the addon in the settings, as usual. You can now create a `LaTeX` node and start your math excapades!
